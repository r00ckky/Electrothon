In India, we do not have a proper e waste disposal network. Our application aims to connect the e waste disposal companies with those who wish to sell their e waste.
Why would you sell your e waste to us? Is question that comes up in one’s mind after hearing about the concept we built our application:
Well to answer that we introduce to you Clutter coin. Just like in a arcade gaming shop where you get tickets for winning games and exchange the said tickets for various goodies, our application allows you to exchange the above mentioned Clutter coins for various goodies. 
How will one earn these Clutter coins?
To earn these clutter coins we have two features in our application:
1.E-WASTE<br>
2.E-RECEIPT
<br>

When one clicks on E waste, they will be directed to page where they can either track the order or send request for pick-up of E Waste.

When one clicks on “MAKE REQUEST” the certified e-waste disposal company that is nearest to your location is sent request, for pickup and when one clicks on “TRACK REQUEST” you can see how much time is left till your waste is picked up, or if the waste that was picked up has reached the company or not.

If one goes to market for purchase of item, a receipt is always generated, most of us keep it so as to keep a tally of our expenses but, after that we chuck them into the dustbins. One can now save the same receipt on our app and get rewarded with Clutter coins. The shopkeeper can either scan your QR code and send the receipt directly to your registered mail or the consumer can scan the seller’s QR code by clicking on “scan” and automattically send the receipt to the registered mail.
By clicking on “CLUTTER COINS” one can see the amount of Clutter coin accumulated by one. 
By clicking on “Redeem Coins” one can buy goodies in excahnge for clutter coins.

In the bottom right corner is the community section from where you can come in contact with the developers and ask questions related to application or you can contact the e waste companies and send message to a known that is registered on our application.
